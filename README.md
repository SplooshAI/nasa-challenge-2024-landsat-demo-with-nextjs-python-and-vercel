# Welcome

This is my project for the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

## Getting started

This project was initially built using `create-next-app` and the example Next.js and FastAPI template at [https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi) as a starting point:

```sh
npx create-next-app my_app --example "https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi"

```

Please see [GETTING_STARTED](./GETTING_STARTED.md) or view the GitHub repo at [https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi) for more details.
